In task 4,thats in the same folder as task3, i improved task 3.

in task 3, i built a Dgraph using task 2 algorithm, and played the game pacman on him.
i used Jframe tools and in speciific STDDRraw library in the UI. i created User-gameplay when the user can
move each of the robots manualy and as well automat gameplay where the robot beeing placed on board and moving idealy to get 
as much points as possible.
i alse writen every game played as a kml file,that can be showen on google earth platforms.

in task 4,i added the current features:
1.the possibility to log in to the server, and send kml files to the server.
2.getting data from the server and printing it.

as well in this task i had needed to pass the server games,when i cant reach higer level until i finished the current level.
